# Progress: 8/356 exercises

This repository is me working through all the exercises in “Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs” (by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman).

I wrote in my book “[Junior to Senior](https://gum.co/junior-to-senior)”:

> Widely known simply as “SICP” and praised by many developers, this is an introductory Computer Science course at MIT turned into a book. It uses a dialect of Lisp for instruction (remember how useful it is to learn a language different from what you know?) and moves assuredly and swiftly through some advanced concepts.
>
> We’re not aiming to replicate a Computer Science degree, but to revisit or learn the fundamentals. Again, you don't _need_ to read [it] or do the exercises, but [it is] fun and accessible if you're diligent, and you can learn a lot even if you're more experienced.

Never worked through the whole book myself (and I feel like my software construction skills are lacking), so I decided to take my own advice and do all 356 exercises. This is going to be fun (cue Dwarf Fortress fun meme).

The code is written in **R5RS Scheme** and you can run the files directly by [downloading Racket](https://download.racket-lang.org/) and running **DrRacket**.

## SICP Online

The book is available for free on the [MIT Press website](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/). This is the version I'm reading.

The July 1986 version of the MIT 6.001 course is also available for free on the [MIT OpenCourseWare YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE18841CABEA24090). There are twenty lectures, presented by the authors of the book themselves. The sound is not great, but you can turn on subtitles.

As an alternative, there are [SICP video lectures](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter) for the Berkeley Computer Science 61A course (2011).
